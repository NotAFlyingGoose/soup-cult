      <h1>So, you want to join the soup cult.</h1>

      <h2>It's not as simple as 123 but you can look at the process here:</h2>

      <p>
        First you have to contact a recruiter; You can find a list of recruiters
        below:
        <br /><br />
        <b>HolyFlyingGoose, Mistere6</b>
        <br /><br />
        The recruiters don't have full time jobs so don't worry if there's
        nobody there. Just tell the recruiter that you want to join the cult and
        he will do the rest.
        <br /><br />
        The next step in the process is answering a list of questions the
        recruiter asks you from a list below. He will then send off your answers
        to be reviewed. These questions exist as a safty precaution to make sure
        nobody with evil intent ends up in the guild. After that you may or may
        not be accepted into the guild. If you're accepted your rank will be
        Soup Trial and you will be watched closely.
