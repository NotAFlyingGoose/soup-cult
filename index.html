          The Soup Cult is a skyblock guild that worships and prays to the
          mushrooms god. If you want to read about the origins of the guild,
          check out <a href="/bible/">The Mushroom Bible</a>. In The Cult, we
          worship

            >holy soup</a
          >, which is made from mushrooms, redstone, and glowstone.

          The Cult is structured like a democracy. At the bottom are Soup
          Trials, who must prove themselves worthy by demostrating their love
          for soup. Next is Soup Cultist, who prays and serves to the Mushroom
          God and is a general follower of the soup. Then there is the Soup
          Council, who votes on actions they think the cult should take. Then
          you have the Cult Leader who runs the cult and is in charge of the
          Council. He can veto any decision the Council makes (other than voting
          off the leader of course). If the Leader can no longer work or if the
          Council votes him off, then a new Council member would be elected from
          within the Council. The current leader is <b>Mistere</b>.
